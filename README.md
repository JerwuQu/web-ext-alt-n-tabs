Web Extension to active tabs by using Control+&lt;number>

# Why

I use `alt+&lt;number>` to switch workspaces, and it annoyed me that it wasn't easy to change the tab selection hotkey in Firefox to `Control+&lt;number>`. After looking at all the existing key remapping plugins that seemed to me too much I decided to write this for myself. If you like it too please use it :)
